# slack-statsbot

This is a [Slack](https://slack.com) bot that monitors and reports on who is speaking in channels. It is an experiment by users of the [LGBTQ in Technology Slack](http://lgbtq.technology/).

[![Deploy](https://www.herokucdn.com/deploy/button.png)](https://heroku.com/deploy?template=https://github.com/backspace/slack-statsbot/tree/primary)

There seems to be no way to set the number of worker processes via the above Deploy button, so after the application has started, you should set the number of worker processes to 1. You can do this via the Heroku web interface at https://dashboard.heroku.com/apps/yourappname or by running `heroku ps:scale worker=1 -a yourappname`.
